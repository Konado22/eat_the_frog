# Eat the Frog - Task Manager

## Description

The purpose of this application is to serve as a task manager with a built in incentive system for the user to help them stay more accountable and stay more productive. The concent of "Eat the Frog" comes from a Mark Twain quote where he says, “If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.”

Out of the many task manager applications in existence, this one serves to be unique in that it gives the user the ability to customize their layout and also provides a reward system for completing more tasks, which ultimately leads to a greater sense of accomplishment and happiness for the user.

## Installation

There is no installation necessary for this application. It is web-based and the user only needs an internet connection and a mobile device or desktop computer to use the program.

## Usage

To use the application, the user may customize their layout by displaying or hiding a weather component where they can keep the weather of any city of their choice in view. They may also hide or show a component that displays dad jokes. If they hide either component, they will be shown a funny picture of a frog in its play, with the option to show the component again. The main component of the program is used by the user entering tasks in the space under the text 'Frogs to Eat Today', after which they will appear in a list in the red 'New Daily Task' box. If the user wishes to remove a task without completing it, they may do so by hitting the 'Remove' button. Once they complete a task, they may drag the task item to the green Completed Task box down below. Once the user drags an item to the Completed Task box, the badge count will increase by one. At the end of the week on every Sunday, the user will get a reward message for completing x number of tasks, and the badge count will go back to 0.
